      <h3>History</h3>
      <p>
        The Indian National Congress at its XVII Session of December 1901 passed
        a resolution stating that: The Indian National Congress is of opinion
        that a Government College of Mining Engineering be established in some
        suitable place in India on the models of the Royal School of Mines in
        England... The institute originally offered courses mainly in Mining
        Engineering and Applied Geology when it opened. In 1957, the institute
        began offering courses in Petroleum Engineering and Applied Geophysics
        and the name was changed to Indian School of Mines. Up to 1967, it was a
        government institute where the faculties were recruited through Union
        Public Service Commission (UPSC). The school was granted university
        status by the University Grants Commission under the University Grants
        Commission Act, 1956 in 1967. Later courses in Mining Machinery
        Engineering and Mineral Engineering were started in 1975 and 1976
        respectively. It was among the few institutes to start courses in
        Industrial Engineering and Management (in 1977), to cater to the needs
        of industries like metallurgy, mining and manufacturing. While a
        proposal to upgrade ISM Dhanbad to an Institutes of National Importance
        had been put as early as 1994 by a Government Committee, no action
        was taken by the Government over this proposal. A proposal for the
        conversion was included in the 12th Five year plan after its passage
        through the National Development Council (NDC), on 27 December 2012,
        and put across the IIT Council on 7 January 2013. The Union Finance
        Minister Arun Jaitley, during his budget speech in Parliament on 28
        February 2015, proposed to upgrade ISM Dhanbad into an IIT. On
        25 May 2016, the Union Cabinet approved that a bill be introduced in
        Parliament for converting ISM Dhanbad into an IIT. On 19 July 2016
        the Institutes of Technology (Amendment) Bill, 2016 was introduced into
        the Lok Sabha. It was passed by the Lok Sabha without opposition on 25
        July 2016. The Rajya Sabha unanimously passed the Bill on 2 August 2016.
        The Bill got the Presidential assent and a Gazette notification was made
        on 6 Sep 2016, thus officially conferring Indian Institute of Technology
        tag to erstwhile Indian School of Mines,Dhanbad .
